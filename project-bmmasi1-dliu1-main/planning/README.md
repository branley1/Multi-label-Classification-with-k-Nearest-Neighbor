## Week 1 Planning

### Goals ###
This is what you plan to accomplish in the first week of the project, leading up
to our lab meeting.  You must fill this in as part of your proposal.
* Hand in the full proposal
* Task/Goal 1: Implement full version of KNN ranking algorithm outlined by paper
* Task/Goal 2: Implement Hamming Loss evaluation method

### Update ###

Complete this section ahead of lab for week 1 of the project
* We handed in our proposal and created this timeline


### Requests ###
We need advice about/help with ... (optional):

------
## Week 2 Planning

This is what you plan to accomplish in the second week of the project, leading up
to our lab meeting.  You must fill this in as part of your proposal; update after
each checkpoint as necessary (i.e. as your plan evolves, this document should
reflect the changes). 

### Goals ###

* **TODO:  Fill in this section for each week as part of the proposal**
* Present mid-project review in lab
* Implement standard multi-label models
* Compare performance to ranking KNN model
* Implement other evaluation methods if we have time? 

### Update ###

Complete this section ahead of lab for week 2 of the project
* We have completed ranking section of KNN algorithm

### Requests ###

## Week 3 Planning

This is what you plan to accomplish in the third week of the project, leading up
to our lab meeting.  You must fill this in as part of your proposal; update after
each checkpoint as necessary (i.e. as your plan evolves, this document should
reflect the changes). 

### Goals ###

* **TODO:  Fill in this section for each week as part of the proposal**
* Finish everything we didn't do in previous 2 weeks
* Test on other datasets
* Week 1 and 2 probably have way more stuff than we can humanly do, so this is catchup week(?)
* start on paper

### Update ###

Complete this section ahead of lab for week 3 of the project

* We have implemented everything in KNN algorithm except for SVM ranking (which we should be able just to pull from a library or something) and generating weights (which we have no idea how to do)

### Requests ###
We need advice about/help with ... (optional):
paper describes generating weights - not sure exactly what they mean

## Week 4 Planning

This is what you plan to accomplish in the fourth week of the project, leading up
to our lab meeting.  You must fill this in as part of your proposal; update after
each checkpoint as necessary (i.e. as your plan evolves, this document should
reflect the changes). 

### Goals ###

* **TODO:  Fill in this section for each week as part of the proposal**
* Write Paper
* Work on presentation

### Update ###

Complete this section ahead of lab for week 4 of the project

* We have also completed ...
* We are stuck on ...

## Post-Week 4 Planning

### Goals ###

* Our last Lab meeting is April 26th
* Experimental work should ideally complete a week ahead of time so you can focus on writing
* Paper due on last day of classes (April 28th)
* Work on Final presentation, to be delivered during final exam slot
