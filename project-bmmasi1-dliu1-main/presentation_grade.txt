Delivery: 7
Content: 7
Timing: 10 [14:00]
Q/A: 9
Notes:
  - didn't introduce speakers
  - good introduction to topic verbally, but no slide to go with it?
  - again, examples were discussed, but would be nice to have some images (e.g.
    when talking about images, why not show images of those types?)
  - speech is clear and volume is generally good
  - explanation of what you mean by "trustworthiness" could have been clearer
  - a bit odd to introduce the dataset so late in the presentation
  - some of the bits towards the end felt less practiced than the earlier parts
  - very little in the way of results presentation
